Bamazon

I created a mini-shopping experience using mySQL and Node, and utilizing the Inquirer npm package. When you run “node bamazonCustomer.js”, you will see a list of 10 items:

Item ID for each product
Name of Product
Department of Product
Price
Quantity Available

After reviewing the products, you are prompted to input the item ID of the item you would like to purchase. You are then prompted to input the quantity of that item that you want to purchase. If there is sufficient inventory, the program will confirm your order and display the details and the total that you owe. If there is insufficient inventory, you are prompted to choose another product.
